1. User is on Youtube app. 
2. User receives Youtube shorts video push notification. 
3. User navigates to notification center screen of the app.
4. User locate that shorts video & plays it from notification center of the app.
5. while user playing that shorts video, user also clicks the received push notification to open that video. 
6. Same shorts video starts to play. 
7. User clicks back button previous instant of same video playing. 

Actual - 
Same video plays even user has opened video from different location. 

Expected - 
Only single instance of SAME video should be playing. on back button click it should dismiss that video screen. 
Looks for YT shorts video always uses "Standard Launch" mode for shorts video playing activity. 



Note - I am on latest version on android app at the time of reporting. 
Android 11 from Google.
