Scrolling feature suggestion on Daylio app . 
There is nice "Show Today" button above FAB button that takes user to today's entry. 
The similar action can be introduced below screens - 
1. On search notes screen with "Activities" expanded - good to have option that takes user to top or bottom of screen in one button click. 
2. You are on search RESULTS page - good to have option that takes user to top or bottom of screen in one button click. 
3. You are adding new entry on screen with title "What have you been up to?" - good to have option that takes user to top or bottom of screen in one button click. 


Note - I am on latest version on android app at time of reporting. 
Android 11 from Google.
