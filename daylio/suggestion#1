If user tries to add another entry at the same time, it will be nice to show pop-up asking if user wants 
to merge to existing entry or not. 
If user clicks yes it should merge else it should create it as new entry. 



Note - I am on latest version on android app at time of reporting. 
Android 11 from Google.
